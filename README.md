# Sparks-Foundation-Internship-Tasks

Task 1:

CSV file contains Hours and Scores of some students. The main goal is to predict Scores of student based on their studing hours.

Exploratory data analysis, Preprocessing and Machine learning Linear Regression have been used. Also I have added the option to predict student score with entering a different student studying hours which is not present in the CSV file.


Task 2: 

CSV file contains characteristics of different plants. The main goal is to Classifiy each plant according to the given features.

Exploratory data analysis, Preprocessing and Machine learning K-means (un-supervised learning) have been used.


Task 3:

CSV file contains super market sales with many chains across The United States of America.

Exploratory data analysis is done to clarify which States, Regions, Products....

Due to an optimization issue between library Plotly and github, Dashboard of profit and sales of the whole USA is not shown in the Notebook

Dashboard between Profit and each States: ![Profit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79969562/181242569-3082b3d8-35a2-468a-a7bd-9be8e95b11f6.png)

Finial Observations:

1- Maxumium sales are in west and east regions.

2- California has the higgest sales and Newyork comes in second.

3- California and Newyork have the higgest profit margin.

4- Sales of Technology is the higgest.

5- Sales should be 20% at most to maximize profit.

Task 4:

CSV file contains characteristics of different plants. The main goal is to Classifiy each plant according to the given features.

Exploratory data analysis, Preprocessing and Machine learning Decision Tree (supervised learning) have been used.
